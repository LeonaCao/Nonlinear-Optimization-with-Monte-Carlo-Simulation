# Nonlinear-Optimization-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

In this project I and my teammates scraped stock prices from Yahoo! Finance and analyze on them for nonliear optimization. 
We were trying to allocate given amount of money to certain stocks and maximize the return while accounting for the risk tolerance.
We also used the Python solver Pyomo to solve our model. Besides, Monte Carlo Simulation was conducted to identify the efficient frontier.
